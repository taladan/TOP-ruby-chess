# [The Odin Project - Chess](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project)

Chess is the Ruby Final Project for the Odin Project.

To begin with, I'm porting over most of my code from my [Knight's Travails](https://github.com/taladan/TOP-ruby-kt) solution.  I'll be pulling out any code that isn't relevant to the chess game.
